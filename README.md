# ctex-file-viewer
A html page that allows you to view .ctex files, which are compressed image textures found within apps/games made using Godot.

WARNING: The html was 100% written by Chat GPT. I'm not a programmer.

step 1: Run the 'ctex filed viewer.html'
step 2: Click 'Select Files' and select one or more .ctex files.
step 3: Click 'convert' and it'll output the image files.

I have a habit of going through game files and I came across these .ctex files inside a godot game. I looked for ways to view these files but there's isn't any reliable way to view them quickly. So I had to ask GPT and it came up with this. I tried it with a few ctex files and it definitely works. 

Hope it's useful.
